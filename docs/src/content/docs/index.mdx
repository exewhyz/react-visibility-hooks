    the box.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Tree-Shakeable" icon="seti:json">
    Import only the hooks you need — unused hooks are automatically excluded from your
    bundle.

## The Hooks

| Hook                                                          | Description                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| [`useDocVisible`](/hooks/use-doc-visible/)                    | Is the browser tab visible?                      |
| [`useIdleVisibility`](/hooks/use-idle-visibility/)            | Page visibility + user idle detection            |
| [`useAutoPauseVideo`](/hooks/use-auto-pause-video/)           | Auto-pause/resume `<video>` on tab visibility    |
| [`useSmartPolling`](/hooks/use-smart-polling/)                | Visibility-aware data polling with dedup         |
| [`usePageFocusEffect`](/hooks/use-page-focus-effect/)         | Callbacks on visibility transitions              |
| [`useNetworkAwarePolling`](/hooks/use-network-aware-polling/) | Smart polling + network quality awareness        |
| [`useInactivityTimeout`](/hooks/use-inactivity-timeout/)      | Session timeout with warning countdown           |
| [`useWakeLock`](/hooks/use-wake-lock/)                        | Prevent screen dimming                           |
| [`useBatteryAware`](/hooks/use-battery-aware/)                | React to device battery level and charging state |

## Quick decision guide

- Start with **useDocVisible** when you only need to pause/resume work on tab hide/show.
- Choose **useSmartPolling** for visibility-aware API polling with deduped updates.
- Choose **useNetworkAwarePolling** when polling should adapt to offline and slow networks.
- Use **useInactivityTimeout** for session timeout UX with warning countdowns.
- Use **useWakeLock** to keep the screen awake during long-running user flows.
- Use **useBatteryAware** to reduce work and preserve battery on low power.
